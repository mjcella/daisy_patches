A collection of gen~ patchers compatible with the Electrosmith Daisy Patch eurorack module

# skipmin

A gate skipper similar to the Skipmin but with CV control and doesn't cost a roughly a billion dollars for a used module.

- Audio in 1-4: signal input. The gates to possibly skip

- Controls 1-4: manual control over probability. All the way left: 0%. All the way right: 100%

- CV 1-4: modulate the probability with CV. Controls 1-4 trim the input signals in this mode.

- Audio out 1-4: gate output. The gates after possibly skipping some.
